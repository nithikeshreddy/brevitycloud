***BrevityCloud enhances your browsing experience by providing AI-powered text summarization, page interaction via chat, image text detection, and voice input directly within your browser.***

## Features

*   **Webpage Summarization:** Get concise summaries of web articles using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) or AWS Kendra.
*   **Chat with Page Context:** Ask questions about the current webpage content.
*   **Image Text Detection:** Right-click on any image on a webpage to detect and extract text using AWS Rekognition.
*   **Voice Input:** Use your microphone to dictate queries instead of typing.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user accounts managed by AWS Cognito.
*   **History:** View your recent summaries and chat interactions.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](resources/Architecture.png)

*   **Frontend:** Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
*   **Backend:** Serverless functions on AWS Lambda (Python 3.9).
*   **API:** Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API).
*   **AI/ML Services:**
    *   AWS Bedrock (Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet) for summarization & chat QA.
    *   AWS Kendra for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based summarization/chat.
    *   AWS Rekognition for image text detection.
    *   AWS Transcribe for voice-to-text.
*   **Authentication:** AWS Cognito.
*   **Database:** AWS DynamoDB for user data and history.
*   **Storage:** AWS S3 for webpage content indexing (Kendra) and temporary audio files (Transcribe).
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform with modular structure.

## Getting Started

For detailed setup instructions, usage scenarios, and development information, please see the **[USER MANUAL](USER-MANUAL.md)**.

## Request observability

The summary/chat Lambda writes JSON events to its existing CloudWatch Logs stream,
including `request_started`, `retrieval_started`/`retrieval_completed`,
`bedrock_invocation_started`/`bedrock_invocation_completed`, `request_completed`,
and stage-specific errors. Filter by `request_id` to follow an invocation: this is
Lambda's AWS request ID, or a generated UUID when running without Lambda context.
The same handler also logs history, preflight, and rejected requests.

Completion events include `duration_ms` measured with a monotonic clock; request
completion also includes the existing HTTP `status_code`. Request duration covers
authentication, indexing waits, retrieval, generation, and history storage.
Retrieval timing covers each `query_kendra` call (including S3 fallback), so retries
produce multiple event pairs. Operation outcomes are `returned`, `no_result`, or
`error` (an escaping exception); `returned` can include fallback content. Handled
service failures emit separate error events even if the request ultimately returns
HTTP 200. A Lambda timeout or process termination can prevent completion logging.

Logs exclude request/response bodies, prompts, document content, URLs, user IDs,
credentials, and tokens. Errors record only exception class names, without exception
messages or tracebacks. No additional dependencies or infrastructure are required.
